[4mSo what is a clog?[0m

A clog is a tiny blog that is meant to be read in the terminal using the 
curl command. If you want to start your own clog simplyfollow these steps:

1) Copy this clog directory to the root of your website.
2) Delete this post (remove the line in index for it too).
3) run new.sh to create a new post.

Thats it, your clog will be viewable at:

	curl -s www.yourwebsite.com/clog/index

You can add any introduction text you want before the "Posts:" line in index.
Everythin after "Posts:" should be a line referencing a post.

Enjoy!
